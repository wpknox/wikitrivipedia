The wikitrivipedia game was made for the ISU Fall 2018 Hackathon. The game finds a random Wikipedia page, creates a question based off the
page, takes the title of the page as one of the answers, then searches three more times for other Wikipedia pages within the same category
for incorrect answers. The user plays until they get a question wrong, then the game is over.

There are three parts to the project in the files attached.
